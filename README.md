## My process

This Project was built with react and i also used flex-wrapping to wrap the various sector
I started building the project on a mobile version first and then built the desktop version
i used json-server to fetch the various data from the json file and i also used a conditional statement to map through the json file and iterate to give multiple component at once

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind css
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through this project i was able to put my knowledge of react conditional statement in practice and also learnt how to use json-server when working with react project. This is also my first completed Project using tailwind css and it was great

### Continued development

A little glitch i look to fix in coming time is the Profile section which is constanly changing in size after every change in the stats timeframe

### Useful resources

You can check out the tailwind css doc it really helped me through this project
